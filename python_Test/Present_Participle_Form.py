# Exercise 25 - Present Participle Form

# In English, the present participle is formed by adding the suffix -ing to the infinite form:
# go -> going.
# A simple set of heuristic rules can be given as follows:

# If the verb ends in e, drop the e and add ing (if not exception: be, see, flee, knee, etc.)
# If the verb ends in ie, change ie to y and add ing
# For words consisting of consonant-vowel-consonant, double the final letter before adding ing
# By default just add ing
# Your task in this exercise is to define a function make_ing_form()
# which given a verb in infinitive form returns its present participle form.
# Test your function with words such as lie, see, move and hug.
# However, you must not expect such simple rules to work for all cases.

def make_ing_form(word):
    exceptions = ['be', 'see', 'flee', 'knee', 'canoe']
    vowels = 'aeiou'

    if word.endswith('ie'):
        return word[:-2] + 'y' + 'ing'

    elif word.endswith('e') and word not in exceptions:
        return word[:-1] + 'ing'

    elif len(word) >= 3 and word[-1] not in vowels and word[-2] in vowels and word[-3] not in vowels:
        return word + word[-1] + 'ing'

    else:
        return word + 'ing'


words = ['lie', 'see', 'move', 'hug', 'go']
for word in words:
    print(f"{make_ing_form(word)}")
